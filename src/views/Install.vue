    <h2>2 - Computer configuration</h2>
    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>
      First, you need to install
      <a
        href="https://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
      >
        WinPcap
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>Then double-click on <code>lan-play-win64.exe</code>.</p>
    <h3>MacOS</h3>
    <p>
      First, you need to install
      <a href="https://brew.sh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
        Homebrew</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>Then in a terminal: <code>brew install libpcap libuv</code></p>
    <p>Finally in a terminal: <code>sudo ./lan-play-macos</code></p>
    <h3>Ubuntu/Debian</h3>
    <p>
      In a terminal: <code>sudo apt install libpcap0.8-dev libuv1-dev</code>
    </p>
    <p>Finally in a terminal: <code>sudo ./lan-play-linux</code></p>
    <h2>3 - Start the LAN Play Client</h2>
    <p>
      The application will prompt you to enter the relay server address. You can
      choose the server you want, like <code>switch.lan-play.com:11451</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to run the client administratively and allow it through your
      firewall.
    </p>
    <h2>4 - Test you have setup everything correctly</h2>
    <p>
      You can test if you have setup everything correctly by putting your Switch
      to sleep and waking it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      If everything is good, you should see IConnection on your lan-play client.
      It will look like:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        alt="IConnection"
        class="screenshot"
        :src="require(`@/assets/switch/iconnection.jpg`)"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not, verify your switch settings, ensure there is no autoconnect
      profile for a different wireless profile, and try rebooting your switch.
      <strong>
        Failing the internet and/or DNS connectivity test on your switch
        <b>DOES NOT MATTER</b> and can be ignored.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If this continues to fail, join #help on the lan-play discord for further
      assistance.
